# üè°Housing Price Prediction  

This repository contains a Machine Learning pipeline for predicting **California housing prices** using the **California Housing Dataset**.  
The project demonstrates a complete workflow including:  

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical features)  
- Stratified train-test split  
- Model training with `RandomForestRegressor`  
- Saving and loading models using `joblib`  
- Running inference on unseen data
